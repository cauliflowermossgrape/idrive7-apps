/**
 * Part of Redline's experimental features; README.md in this folder has the whole picture
 * (settings, learning, files, logs, rules for this code).
 *
 * Redline on the head-up display, through cluster-render (robertnisipeanu/idrive-apps,
 * native/cluster-render): one image layer on its 'hud' target, an 800x480 scene the KOMBI
 * lays over BMW's own HUD content (speed, limit sign, guidance stay in their own slots).
 *
 *   - What the glass shows (G21, 2026-11-07 test pattern): about x 120..680, y 120..360 of the
 *     scene, BMW's speed and limit sign along its bottom from y ~325. The tach is a 400x130
 *     image centred at y 150 (a 520 px sample was far too big on the glass); "HUD size" scales
 *     it about its top centre, "HUD position" moves it. Both only move the layer, so they show
 *     at once.
 *   - Dark pixels are see-through on the HUD glass: drawn on alpha 0, lit parts at full
 *     brightness; unlit segments optionally faint ("dim").
 *   - cluster-render gives way to BMW's HUD pop-ups by itself; this module logs the target's
 *     state, including 'disabled' from its mapping guard.
 *   - Only the changed rectangle of each frame is sent (the bar moving is a narrow strip), at
 *     most 10 a second, nothing when the frame is the same.
 *   - Never throws: an uncaught error exits the app, MainApp's CorruptAppsHandler wipes an
 *     app's data on its first crash and uninstalls it on the second.
 *
 *   - Directions (setting "hudNav", hud-nav.js, nav.js): while a route runs, the next turn as a second picture
 *     (200x76) in the bottom right corner of the glass. With a route but no turn it can read, Redline steps aside so BMW's
 *     own card shows (the KOMBI hides it behind Redline).
 *   - The tyre widget (settings "hudTyreWidget" ..., hud-tyres.js, tyres.js): the four tyres in the same corner, the same
 *     layer, when the directions have nothing to show (while a tyre is low, by default).
 *
 * Settings: hud (off | on | test); groups "HUD style" (layout, colours, lights, grade, peak, shake,
 * unlit), "HUD readouts" (gear, boost, each temperature, the cold limit, smart temperatures, units),
 * "HUD position and size"; hudLead (also the screen's lights). README.md lists them.

 *            falling for 300 ms (a lift; a traction dip is shorter);

 * rpmShow (optional): the rpm drawn, between samples moved on along the climb (the HUD smooths it);
