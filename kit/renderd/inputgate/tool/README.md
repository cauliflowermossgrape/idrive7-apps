# Controller gate, Store package (mgu-inputgate)

The Store installs the controller gate from this folder (mgu-repo.json `tools`, id `mgu-inputgate`), on iDrive 7 and iDrive 8.
It is the Store's own preload layout (a boot guard before the HMI, a check after it, a drop-in that reads
`/run/mgu-inputgate.env`), packed here because the Store's preload entry names one HMI unit and process:

- `guard.sh` picks the HMI when it runs: `Hmi8` / `hmi8.service` on iDrive 8, `HmiMain3D` / `hmi.service` on iDrive 7.
  Two starts without the HMI coming up healthy with the gate and it is left out (`/var/opt/mgu-inputgate/strikes`).
- The units order themselves against both HMI services; the drop-in goes to both (the one for the HMI the unit
  does not have is never read).
- Same unit and drop-in names as the Store's preload package (1.0.0), and `restart` / `recmgr` empty: an update writes
  the files and reloads systemd, nothing is stopped or restarted (a stopped service reboots the head unit). It loads
  at the next head-unit start.

`mgu-inputgate.so` is a copy of `../../prebuilt/mgu-inputgate.so` (the Store reads a tool's files from its own
folder): copy it here again whenever the gate is rebuilt, and raise the version in `component.json`.
